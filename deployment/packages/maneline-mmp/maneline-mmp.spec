%description
The Mustang Micro Plus part of maneline: programs that talk to a Fender
Mustang Micro Plus headphone amplifier over Bluetooth LE, without the
vendor's phone app.

mmp-web serves a small browser page and an HTTP API and keeps the one
connection the amp allows; mmp-backup and mmp-restore save and write back
the amp's presets; mmp-audition tries a preset without storing it; mmp-check
checks the amp after a firmware update; mmp-level measures preset loudness.

Needs BlueZ 5.84 or newer with "Experimental = true" in
/etc/bluetooth/main.conf and the amp paired over LE: see
MUSTANG_MICRO_PLUS_LINUX.md in the documentation.

The rest of maneline (the Mustang LT amplifiers over USB, the Android and
desktop apps) is not part of this package.
